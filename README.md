# Sparse-ECG-denoising
Sparsity based ECG denoising
This project comprises of using sparsity based models to denoise the essential components of ECG.
Specifically, three different models have been compared and their results have been analysed.
The models include:
1) Generalized Minimax Concave penalty (GMC)
2) Sparsity assisted signal smoothing (SASS)
3) L1 Norm penalty(L1 NORM)
